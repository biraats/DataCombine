","body":"DataCombine\r\n======\r\n\r\nChristopher Gandrud\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2.7\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/DataCombine.png)](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/DataCombine)\r\n\r\nPlease report any **bugs** or **suggestions** at:\r\n<https://github.com/christophergandrud/DataCombine/issues>.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Functions\r\n\r\n**DataCombine** is a set of miscellaneous tools intended to make combining\r\ndata sets--especially time-series cross-section data--easier. The package is\r\ncontinually being developed as I turn lines of code that I frequently use into\r\nsingle functions. It currently includes the following functions:\r\n\r\n- `CountSpell`: function that returns a variable counting the spell number\r\nfor an observation. Works with grouped data.\r\n\r\n- `dMerge`: merges 2 data frames and report/drop/keeps only duplicates.\r\n\r\n- `DropNA`: drops rows from a data frame when they have missing (`NA`) values on a\r\ngiven variable(s).\r\n\r\n- `FillDown`: fills in missing (`NA`) values with the previous on-missing value\r\n\r\n- `FillIn`: fills in missing values of a variable from one data frame with the\r\nvalues from another variable.\r\n\r\n- `FindReplace`: replaces multiple patterns found in a character string column\r\nof a data frame.\r\n\r\n- `grepl.sub`: subsets a data frame if a specified pattern is found in a\r\ncharacter string.\r\n\r\n- `InsertRow`: allows user to insert a row into a data frame. Largely\r\nimplements: [Ari B. Friedman's function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11562428).\r\n\r\n- `MoveFront`: moves variables to the front of a data frame. This can be useful\r\nif you have a data frame with many variables and want to move a variable or\r\nvariables to the front.\r\n\r\n- `NaVar`: create new variable(s) indicating if there are missing values in\r\nother variable(s).\r\n\r\n- `PercChange`: calculates the percentage change from a specified lag, including\r\nwithin groups.\r\n\r\n- `shift`: creates lag and lead variables, including for time-series\r\ncross-sectional data. The shifted variable is returned to a new vector. This\r\nfunction is largely based on\r\n[TszKin Julian's shift function](http://ctszkin.com/2012/03/11/generating-a-laglead-variables/).\r\n\r\n- `slide`: creates lag and lead variables, including for time-series\r\ncross-sectional data. The slid variable are added to the original data frame.\r\nThis expands the capabilities of `shift`.\r\n\r\n- `slideMA`: creates a moving average for a period before or after each time\r\npoint for a given variable.\r\n\r\n- `SpreadDummy`: spread a dummy variable (1's and 0') over a specified time\r\nperiod and for specified groups.\r\n\r\n- `StartEnd`: finds the starting and ending time points of a spell, including\r\nfor time-series cross-sectional data.\r\n\r\n- `rmExcept`: removes all objects from a workspace except those specified by the\r\nuser.\r\n\r\n- `TimeFill`: creates a continuous `Unit`-`Time`-`Dummy` data frame from a data\r\nframe with `Unit`-`Start`-`End` times.\r\n\r\n- `VarDrop`: drops one or more variables from a data frame.\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nI will continue to add to the package as I build data sets and run across other\r\npesky tasks I do repeatedly that would be simpler if they were a function.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**DataCombine** is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).\r\n\r\nYou can also install the most recent stable version with `install_github` from\r\nthe [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):\r\n\r\n```{S}\r\ndevtools::install_github('christophergandrud/DataCombine')\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
